// your code goes here

function laugh(){
    var laugh="hahahahahahahahahaha!";
    return laugh;
}

console.log(laugh());


//Here the emphasis is the Console.log, i was able to code the function correctly in the initial run
//We then implemented the proper inside the console is a call to the laugh function
//what i did was type // console.log(laugh);
//I should have added "()"
 //---------------------------------------------Correction was console.log(laugh());
 
 
 //Here i modified the variable to see if changed the output, but i got the same result
 //Expected error, but it seems variable names didnt change the output of the function,
 //further expermination will be done as functions and material gets more advanced.
